FRUIT 2.8
---------

1. FRUIT outputs test report in XML. 
   It can be read by Jenkins( http://jenkins-ci.org/ ).
   A sample report appears as sample/test/result.xml
   in FRUIT 2.8 release.

2. Case names are shown in failed assertion messages
   even when fruit_processor is used.
   Previously __unnamed__ was shown in place of case names.

3. Sample without rake nor rake was in "sample/taste" directry of FRUIT 2.7.
  It is moved to "in_3_minutes" directry.

4. Works both with rake 0.9.2.2 and rake 0.8.7.

5. Debug option of fortran compiler is turned on by default.

For example of 1. and 2. above, see fruit2.8_with_jenkins.png
