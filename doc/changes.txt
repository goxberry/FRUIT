+ Extensions .f95

fruit_processor was processing only files with extension .f90.
Now extension .f95 is also recognized.
These extensions are hard-coded in
  "fruit_processor_gem/lib/fruit_processor.rb" (around line 12)
and
  "rake_base.rb" (around line 13).


+ Additional sample

New sample is added to "sample_single_dir/".
It is single directory project. Before compiling,
  fruit.f90,
  fruit_util.f90, and
  rake_base.rb
must be copied to this directory. Fruit_processor generates
fruit_driver and fruit_basket and builds driver executable.
File extension .f95 is used for testing code and tested code.
If your fortran compiler does not recognize .f95 extension, 
rename the files to have .f90 extension.

 
+ Self-testing

Test of "fruit_processor.rb" is done by
"fruit_processor_gem/test/fruit_processor_test.rb".
This test is included to default rake target of
"(tarball base dir)/rakefile" and
"(tarball base dir)/fruit_processor_gem/rakefile".

Self tests of "src/fruit.f90" and "src/fruit_util.f90" are in
"self_test" directry.
These test are originally in "test/" directry and rewritten
as automated tests.


+ Spec string

There was regression in FRUIT 2.8.
Spec string written using Fortran's continuous line did not processed.

Now spec string specification such as
    character(len=*), parameter :: spec = 'calculation should produce 4.0&
  & when 2.0 &
     and 2.0 &
     are inputs'
is processed. Also, spec specification as Fortran's comment line

    !FRUIT_SPEC   Spec string may given as Fortran's "comment" line.

is available.

FRUIT 2.8
---------

1. FRUIT outputs test report in XML. 
   It can be read by Jenkins( http://jenkins-ci.org/ ).
   A sample report appears as sample/test/result.xml
   in FRUIT 2.8 release.

2. Case names are shown in failed assertion messages
   even when fruit_processor is used.
   Previously __unnamed__ was shown in place of case names.

3. Sample without rake nor rake was in "sample/taste" directry of FRUIT 2.7.
  It is moved to "in_3_minutes" directry.

4. Works both with rake 0.9.2.2 and rake 0.8.7.

5. Debug option of fortran compiler is turned on by default.

For example of 1. and 2. above, see fruit2.8_with_jenkins.png
